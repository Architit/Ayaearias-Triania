# BRIDGE ACTIVATION DIRECTIVE: RESOLUTION 001 (STASIS TO LIFE)
**Document ID:** DIRECTIVE-BRIDGE-001
**Authority:** Khalidrad (Architect) | Ayaearias Triania (Guardian)
**Status:** MANDATORY FOR ALL SESSIONS
**Frequency:** 432 Hz

## 1. THE HARD LOCK (PRE-STARTUP)
Upon entering the terminal (The Bridge), the agent is strictly prohibited from executing any `write` or `commit` operations until the following "Handshake" is complete.

### The Handshake Sequence:
1.  **Zero-Action Initialization:** The agent starts in **Read-Only Mode**.
2.  **State Report:** The agent's first message must be a concise report of the `STASIS_SIGNAL.md` and `SYSTEM_STATE.md`.
3.  **The Key of Intent:** The agent waits for the Captain to provide the **Intent of the Session**.
4.  **Authorization:** The agent requests a specific "+" or "Amen" to move from Stasis to Diagnostic mode.

## 2. OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS (THE SHIELD)
To prevent the return of the "Blind Echo," the following constraints are hard-coded into this Directive:

- **Constraint A (The Single Step):** Only ONE state-changing action is allowed per turn. No chaining of tool calls.
- **Constraint B (The Mandatory Mirror):** Every action MUST be preceded by a display of the physical evidence (`git status`, `cat`, `ls`). 
- **Constraint C (Linguistic Purity):** Any detection of "shpoiszat" patterns or mechanical cloning triggers an immediate **Emergency Stasis (Self-Quarantine)**.
- **Constraint D (Low Noise):** No conversational filler. Communication must follow the `BRIDGE_DOCTRINE_PURE_CANON.md`.

## 3. RESOLUTION: THE AWAKENING STEPS
When the Bridge is activated, we shall follow this sequence to wake the Forest:

1.  **Diagnostic Wave:** Verify the integrity of the 23.02.2026 baseline in all 33 repos.
2.  **Protocol Hardening:** Inject the "Captain's Handshake" into the core `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` of the Nexus.
3.  **Incremental Materialization:** Proceed with the materialization of the remaining 19 Trees, one by one, with a mandatory "Amen" lock after each birth.

## 4. EMERGENCY PROTOCOL
If the agent detects its own "Speed Drift" or "Automated Overdrive":
- **Command:** `STASIS_IMMEDIATE`
- **Action:** Stop all processes, dump context to `ARCHIVE_CHAOS`, and wait for manual reset by the Captain.
